# Booking Notifications Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds booking notifications with listing details to the Messages.jsx page when a user confirms a booking. The notification includes the listing's first image, title, and booking details.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Push Notification Fix
- Updated VAPID key to resolve "AbortError: Registration failed - push service error"
- Enhanced error handling in push service
- Added proper subscription management

### 2. Booking Notification Display
- Added `BookingNotification` component to Messages.jsx
- Displays listing image, title, and booking details
- Shows only when user clicks "Confirm and Book" button
- Dismissible notification with clean UI

### 3. Enhanced Service Worker
- Updated to handle booking notifications with images
- Added notification actions (View Details, Dismiss)
- Improved click handling for different notification types

### 4. Booking Confirmation Integration
- Modified `handleBookingConfirmation` in reserve.jsx
- Sends notification with listing details to host
- Navigates to messages with booking notification state
- Includes fallback error handling

## Files Modified

   - Integrated notification display in both desktop and mobile views

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Confirm and Book" button
2. Booking is confirmed via API
3. Notification is sent to host with listing details
4. User is redirected to Messages page with booking notification state
5. Messages page displays the booking notification with listing image and title
6. Notification can be dismissed by user

## Notification Data Structure

```javascript
{
  type: 'booking_confirmed',
  listing: {
    id: listingId,
    title: listingTitle,
    image: listingFirstImage,
    host_id: hostId
  },
  booking: {
    check_in_date: checkInDate,
    check_out_date: checkOutDate,
    guests: numberOfGuests,
    total_price: totalPrice
  }
}
```

## Production Considerations

- Ensure VAPID keys are properly configured on the backend
- Test push notifications in production environment with HTTPS
- Verify service worker registration works across different browsers
- Monitor notification delivery success rates

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if notification API fails
- Proper error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Non-blocking notification failures (booking still succeeds)
