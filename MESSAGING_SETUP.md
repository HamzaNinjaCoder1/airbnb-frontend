## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/services/socketService.js` - Socket.io client service
- `src/services/messagingService.js` - API service for messaging
- `MESSAGING_SETUP.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/Messages.jsx` - Complete rewrite with real backend integration
- `src/pushService.js` - Enhanced with notification management

## How It Works

### 1. Initialization
When a user opens the Messages page:
1. Checks authentication status
2. Requests notification permissions
3. Connects to Socket.io server
4. Loads user's conversations
5. Sets up real-time event listeners

### 2. Sending Messages
1. User types a message
2. Message is sent to backend API
3. Backend saves message to database
4. Socket.io broadcasts message to conversation room
5. Push notification sent to receiver (if subscribed)

### 3. Receiving Messages
1. Socket.io receives new message
2. Message appears in real-time
3. Push notification shown (if app not focused)
4. Message status updates automatically

### 4. Conversation Management
- Conversations are loaded from your backend API
- Each conversation shows latest message and timestamp
- Users can search through conversations
- Mobile users can navigate between list and chat views

## Backend Requirements

Your backend already has all the required endpoints:

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/data/conversations/:userId` - Get user's conversations
- `GET /api/data/messages/get-messages?conversation_id=X` - Get messages for conversation
- `POST /api/data/messages/send-message` - Send a new message
- `POST /api/data/subscribe` - Subscribe to push notifications
- `POST /api/data/unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from push notifications

### Socket.io Events:
- `join-room` - Join a conversation room
- `leave-room` - Leave a conversation room
- `message` - Receive new message
- `typing` - Someone is typing
- `stop-typing` - Stopped typing

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the Messages page
2. Allow notifications when prompted
3. Select a conversation to start chatting
4. Messages appear in real-time
5. Push notifications for new messages when app is not focused

### For Developers:
The system is fully integrated and ready to use. No additional setup required beyond what's already in your backend.

## Browser Support

- Push notifications supported in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Service Worker support required for push notifications

## Security
